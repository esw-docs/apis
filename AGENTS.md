## GitBook Documentation Editing

This repository contains documentation synced with GitBook via Git Sync.

Before editing GitBook-synced Markdown, YAML, or asset files, make sure the GitBook skill is available and up to date in your local agent environment. Prefer installing or updating it with:

```bash
npx skills add gitbookio/gitbook-skills
```

This command may add or update local agent skill files. Use them only as local agent instructions; do not commit those installed skill files or any tool-generated agent configuration unless the user explicitly asks for it.

If `npx` is unavailable, load the skill from:

https://gitbook.com/docs/skill.md

When making changes, preserve GitBook sync metadata such as frontmatter, `SUMMARY.md`, `docs.yaml`, `.gitbook/`, and asset links unless the requested edit explicitly requires changing them.

## Project-specific rules
- When creating a new page, always add a corresponding entry to `SUMMARY.md` at the correct nesting level in the same commit. New pages are invisible in GitBook until they're listed there, with no error raised — this is the single most common cause of "my change didn't show up."
